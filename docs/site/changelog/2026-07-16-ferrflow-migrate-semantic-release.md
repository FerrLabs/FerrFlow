title: 'FerrFlow: Migrate from semantic-release in one command'
summary: 'A new `ferrflow migrate` command reads your existing `.releaserc` and generates the equivalent FerrFlow config, mapping tag format, branches, and the common plugins, and surfacing anything without an equivalent instead of guessing.'

Switching release tools shouldn't mean rewriting your config by hand. `ferrflow migrate` reads an existing semantic-release setup and writes the equivalent `ferrflow.json` for you.

```bash
ferrflow migrate                        # auto-detects .releaserc
ferrflow migrate --from semantic-release
```

It maps what has a FerrFlow equivalent:

- `tagFormat: "v${version}"` → `tagTemplate: "v{version}"`
- `branches` → FerrFlow channels: `main`/`master` become the stable line, a `prerelease` branch becomes a channel
- `@semantic-release/changelog` → the package's `changelog` path
- `@semantic-release/exec` → hooks (`prepareCmd` → `preBump`, `publishCmd` → `postPublish`, and the rest)
- `@semantic-release/github` / `gitlab` → `forge`

The point is what it does with the rest. Anything without a FerrFlow equivalent is **surfaced, never guessed**: `@semantic-release/npm`, custom `commit-analyzer` release rules, and `repositoryUrl` are each reported with a note on what to do, not silently dropped. The command prints a summary of what mapped, what it ignored, and what needs a manual look, and it won't overwrite a config you already have.

```
Migrated semantic-release config from .releaserc → ferrflow.json

Mapped:
  • tagFormat → tagTemplate (v${version})
  • branch main → stable
  • branch beta → prerelease `beta`
  • @semantic-release/github → forge

Review manually:
  ! @semantic-release/npm → not mapped. Configure `publishers` by hand if you publish to npm.
```

JSON `.releaserc` is supported today; a YAML `.releaserc` or a JavaScript `release.config.js` is reported as unsupported rather than mis-read. After migrating, review the generated config, then run `ferrflow validate` and `ferrflow check`.
