Bitbucket users used to fall through FerrFlow's forge detection and had to script release creation by hand. Now `bitbucket.org` remotes are detected automatically (or set `forge = "bitbucket"` explicitly), authenticated with `BITBUCKET_TOKEN`.

Bitbucket has no "release" object the way GitHub and GitLab do, so on Bitbucket a release **is** the annotated tag FerrFlow already creates and pushes: FerrFlow looks it up via the Bitbucket Cloud API and surfaces its URL in the release output. The changelog lives in your `CHANGELOG.md` and the tag message, as usual.

```toml
[workspace]
forge = "bitbucket"   # or leave it "auto": bitbucket.org is detected
```

Pull-request release mode and Bitbucket Server / Data Center aren't supported yet. This first pass covers Bitbucket Cloud release creation, mirroring how Gitea/Forgejo landed.
