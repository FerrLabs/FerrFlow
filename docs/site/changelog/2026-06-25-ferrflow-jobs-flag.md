title: 'FerrFlow: control parallelism with --jobs / FERRFLOW_JOBS'
summary: 'FerrFlow now exposes a global --jobs <N> flag (and FERRFLOW_JOBS env var) to cap how many threads it uses for CPU-parallel work. Default stays all logical cores; --jobs 1 forces single-threaded: handy for constrained CI runners and reproducible benchmarks.'

Since FerrFlow started planning packages and creating releases in parallel, two needs emerged: capping CPU use on small CI runners, and keeping benchmark numbers reproducible regardless of a machine's core count. The new global `--jobs <N>` flag: or the `FERRFLOW_JOBS` env var, with the flag taking precedence: covers both.

- **Default (unset):** all logical cores, exactly as before.
- **`--jobs N`:** caps per-package planning to N threads, and bounds the release-creation HTTP pool by N too: so `--jobs 1` makes the whole run single-threaded.

```bash
# Pin to one thread: deterministic, light on a 2-core runner
ferrflow --jobs 1 release

# Or via the environment
FERRFLOW_JOBS=4 ferrflow release
```

It works with every command, since it's a global flag.
